## Project #1: Topic Modeling
Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)'s news articles are scraped from the official website and are analyzed uner the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to identify hidden topics within the articles and their respective common terms. Furthermore, one can also see how well it conforms with UFC's own article categorization. Source code is under the folder "/code/ufc". More information on the findings can be read [here](https://medium.com/@pradhanang.sanjiv/topic-modeling-on-ufc-news-articles-with-latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-73ea30e4516a).
